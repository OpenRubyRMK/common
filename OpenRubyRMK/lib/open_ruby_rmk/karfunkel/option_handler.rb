          USAGE:
          OpenRubyRMK.rb [-V] [-d] [-l [FILE]] [-L LEVEL]
  
          DESCRIPTION
          OpenRubyRMK is a free and open-source RPG creation program. If you find any
          bugs, please let us know via the mail address openrubyrmk@googlemail.com.
          Below is a summary of possible command-line options, but please note that
          the -l and -L options don't have any effect when -d is passed. It is
          not possible to combine the short options into someting like -lV as the
          tar command allows. You have to pass them separately, for instance as -l -V.
  
          The possible logging levels for the -L option are:
          0 - Debug. Do not use.
          1 - Info. Logs much information on what's going on.
          2 - Warn. This is the default; logs only warnings and errors.
          3 - Error. Log only errors.
          4 - Fatal. Log only errors that cause OpenRubyRMK to crash.
          5 - Unknown. Suppresses any logging. Shouldn't be used.
  
          EXAMPLES
          Show additional information on the console while running
          OpenRubyRMK.rb -l -V
          Same as above
          OpenRubyRMK.rb -l -L1
          Log only fatal errors
          OpenRubyRMK.rb --loglevel=4
          Log only fatal errors, change the log file
          OpenRubyRMK.rb -l /home/freak/mylog.log -L4
          Same as above
          OpenRubyRMK.rb --logfile=/home/freak/mylog.log --loglevel=4
  
          OPTIONS
          EOF
        end
        
        def on_verbose(bool)
          @options[:loglevel] = Logger::INFO if bool
        end
        
        def on_debug(bool)
          @options[:debug] = bool
        end
        
        def on_version
          puts "This is OpenRubyRMK, version #{OpenRubyRMK::VERSION}."
          exit
        end
        
        def on_logfile(file)
          @options[:logfile] = file.nil? ? $stdout : file
        end
        
        def on_loglevel(level)
          @options[:loglevel] = level
        end
        
        def on_help(opts)
          puts opts
          exit
        end
        
      end
