#I monkeypatch the Wx::Image class because the grid cell renderers of the 
#mapset window and the map need to display Wx::Images. Because I can't 
#derive from Wx::GridCellRenderer for whatever reason, I derived my 
#cell renderer from the Wx::GridCellStringRenderer. This one sadly expects 
#strings to render and if fed with a Wx::Image it throws a TypeError. 
#But fortunetaly, in best Ruby convention, it checks wheather the given 
#object responds to #to_str and if so, uses that return value as the string. 
#For this reason, I put in the #to_str method here, which simulates the 
#image was an empty string. 
class Wx::Image
  
  #Returns an empty string. Read in the above code to know why.
