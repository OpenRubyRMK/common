    #According to the wxRuby docs, a GridTableBase is the "database" of a Grid. 
    #Following this explanation, this class supploes the Grid control used in the 
    #mapset window with data, i.e. with images based on the underlying mapset. 
    #
    #The relationships are as follows: 
    #A Grid control gets it's data from the associated GridTableBase. The data 
    #is displayed via a per-cell renderer which is found out by querying the GridTableBase 
    #for a cell's type. For our example, MapsetTableBase will return "MAP_FIELD" as the type 
    #which in turn can be rendered by the FieldRenderer class.
