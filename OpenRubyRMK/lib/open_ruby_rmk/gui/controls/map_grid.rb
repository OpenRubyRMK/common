      #This class is probably that one you most interact with when creating a 
      #game with OpenRubyRMK. It represents the map grid, that is, the tabular 
      #editing field using the most space on the GUI's surface. 
      #
      #A MapGrid is a customized Wx::Grid control, where the biggest customization 
      #is the table base.  With an added "MAP_FIELD" type and a fitting renderer, 
      #this class is able to display the single fields. 
      #
      #Note that when changing values of the MapGrid, you can't use the regular wxRuby 
      #method Grid#set_cell_value, since that one just deals with "STRING" types. Instead, 
      #call #table on the MapGrid and then retrieve the field you want to change from it. 
      #Afterwards, do your changes, and you're done. 
      #  Wx::THE_APP.mainwindow.instance_eval do
      #    #Find out on which map we work at the moment
      #    active_map = THE_APP.selected_map
      #    #Retrieve the map field at the wanted position ((0|0) in this case). 
      #    #Note that you have to specify the position in [row, col] form, not [x, y]!!
      #    field = @map_grid.get_value(0, 0)
      #    #Use another image from the mapset
      #    field.reassign_image(12, 7) #Field (12|7) from the mapset ([x, y] argument form!!)
      #    #Done. No need to call #set_value on the table, since the table 
      #    #holds a reference to the field, so we referenced the exact same field as 
      #    #the table above. 
      #  end
      #
      #Since the MapGrid is, as I just said, frequently used it has the ability to perform 
      #different actions on equal user input, depending on in which _mode_ the grid is. 
      #The mode is just an instance variable called <tt>@mode</tt> with corresponding 
      ##mode and #mode= methods. The default mode is 'paint mode' and the list of 
      #possible modes you can assing to the +mode+ attribute is currently (each is a symbol): 
      #[:erase] Delete mode, in which user clicks clean fields. 
      #[:paint] Paint mode, in which user clicks cause mapset fields placed on the map.
