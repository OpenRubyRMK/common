    #This class is used to render Grid cells of type "MAP_FIELD". Since it's not possible to inherit 
    #from GridCellRenderer, I had to chose a subclass and inherit from that one. This has a fatal side effect: 
    #I can't call +super+ in the #draw method, because I had to supply a "STRING" type. However, without calling 
    #+super+, rendering problems arise if the Grid's cells are not exactly the same size as the mapset's fields. Try it out: 
    #Just uncomment in "mapset_window.rb" the lines that forbid you to resize columns and rows (#create_controls method), and then do 
    #the forbidden thing... :-(
    class FieldRenderer < Wx::GridCellStringRenderer
      
      #Displays the data for the specified cell. Note that I do not call 
      #+super+, since this class is derived from +GridCellStringRenderer+, which 
      #expects "STRING" types.
