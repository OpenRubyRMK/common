  #it doesn't reside in the GUI namespace. This class actually *isn't* GUI-related, but 
  #since wxRuby supplies the image manipulation methods needed for this class (image resizing, 
  #cutting, etc.) and I didn't find a small graphics library that could be used as an extra 
  #dependency of OpenRubyRMK (RMagick is way to big and complicated on Windows)...
