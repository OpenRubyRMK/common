module OpenRubyRMK
  
  #This class represents a map for the OpenRubyRMK. It has nothing to 
  #do with the Map class used inside the created games, beside the fact 
  #that both use the same file format. 
  #
  #The format of the map files is as follows: 
  #They're binary files serialized with Ruby's +Marshal+ module. Inside 
  #is a hash of this form stored: 
  #  {
  #    :name => "the name of the map", 
  #    :mapset => "name of the mapset", 
  #    :table => a_4dimensional_array, 
  #    :parent => the_id_of_the_parent_map_or_zero
  #  }
  #where the 4-dimensional array is simply the description of the three-dimensional 
  #map table (X, Y and Z coordinates) plus the information of the map field that 
  #resides at that position in form of an array. This array has this form: 
  #  [mapset_x, mapset_y, events_hsh]
  #If no field was specified for that position, no array exists but rather a +nil+ object. 
  #TODO: Describe the events hash!
  #
  #You may noticed that the ID of the map isn't contained in the serialized hash. 
  #That's because it is simply determined from the file's name, which should be 
  #like this: 
  #  <id_of_map>.bin
  #For instance: 
  #  3.bin
  #For the map with ID 3. 
  #
  #The map's hierarchy is described in the +structure.bin+ file. It a marshaled hash 
  #of this form: 
  #  {parent_id => {<hash_format>}}
  #It just describes how the map's parent-and-children-relationship gets resolved
  #and has no deep meaning besides making life easier (look at the code 
  #that loads the maps!). If there was a nice way to get the relationship resolved, I'd 
  #go it, especially because a Map object already knows about it's parent and children IDs.
