module OpenRubyRMK
  
  #This module handles plugin integration. A plugin is a Ruby script that resides in 
  #OpenRubyRMK <i>plugins/</i> directory and it's contents will be loaded 
  #at several points of OpenRubyRMK's execution process. See the Plugs.plug_into 
  #method for more information on this. 
  #
  #In a plugin script, +self+ points to the Plugs module (via a module_eval construct) 
  #which allows to write Plugins in a kind of DSL, specified by the methods of the Plugs module. 
  #Inside the Plugs.plug_into method, +self+ again is redirected to something else, specified by the 
  #parameter given to the method. An example plugin script: 
  #  #Encoding: UTF-8
  #  #self is OpenRubyRMK::Plugins::Plugs here
  #  plug_into :mainwindow do
  #    #self is the mainwindow instance here
  #  end
  #  #self is OpenRubyRMK::Plugins::Plugs again
  module Plugins
    
    #This array contains the symbols in which you may plug your scripts into. 
    ALLOWED_PLUGIN_SYMBOLS = [:startup, :finish, :mainwindow, :mapset_window].freeze
    
    #The Plugs module is the namespace in which plugins are executed by default. 
    #It defines the methods necessary to specifiy where you want to plug your plugins 
    #into, rather than filling Ruby's toplevel namespace. The trick is currently done via a 
    #+module_eval+ on the plugin files. 
    #
    #The points where you may plug into are likely to change +self+ inside their block to 
    #something else than Plug's namespace, look at ::plug_into for more information.
