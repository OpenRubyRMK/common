==What is OpenRubyRMK?

OpenRubyRMK is a program to create 2D games. Mostly it's used to create role play games (RPG for short), but if you do enough effort, you can create anything you'd like to. Furthermore, OpenRubyRMK does not want to restrict you in any way, including modifying and deploying itself. It's free in any sense you can think of: You don't have to pay for it (free as in "free beer") _and_ you're free to modify and redistribute the program (free as in "freedom"). The OpenRubyRMK Team is always looking for new developers and contributors: Feel free to report bugs, submit improvements or just propose new features at http://github.com/Quintus/OpenRubyRMK . If you have any questions or don't want to register at GitHub, feel free (once again) to email us at openrubyrmk@googlemail.com; to this adress everyone of us is subscribed, so it's likely to get an answer from more than one team member. 

==How to use it?

OpenRubyRMK is platform-independent. That means, it runs on Linux systems as well as on Macintosh or Microsoft Windows ones. That's because it is written in Ruby, the most beautiful programming language every invented, have a look at it at http://www.ruby-lang.org . For Windows we supply a full-featured installer, on other systems you have to have a working Ruby 1.9 installation (although nothing prevents you from installing Ruby 1.9 on Windows and using that instead of the installer). 

==Windows==

Just start up _bin/OpenRubyRMK.exe_. 

==Other systems==

First, make sure you have a working Ruby 1.9 installation. We recommend 1.9.1-p429, although that might change in the future, since we try to be up to date. Additionally, you have to install these gems: @wxruby-ruby@, @r18n-desktop@. Since the precompiled wxRuby gem causes problems on Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic) and newer, the OpenRubyRMK Team provides gems specifically compiled for recent Ubuntu versions. We did not make any modifications to wxRuby, if you don't trust us you can use the compile bash script available from our {Download page}[http://github.com/Quintus/OpenRubyRMK/Downloads] as well. 

Second, use that Ruby installation to start _bin/OpenRubyRMK.rb_.
