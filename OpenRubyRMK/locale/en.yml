#This file contains the ENGLISH translation for OpenRubyRMK. 
#
#=========================================
#This is the main locale file for OpenRubyRMK. If no translation 
#for any other language is found, OpenRubyRMK looks into this 
#file to at least display _something_. DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE! 
#=========================================
#
#HOWTO TRANSLATE OpenRubyRMK INTO OTHER LANGUAGES
#
#It's really easy! Make a copy of this file inside OpenRubyRMK's locale/ 
#directory and name it as the ISO abbreviation for your language 
#("es.yml" for Spanish, for example). Then start translating all 
#the english words and phrases in your copy and make sure to surround 
#phrases which containg non-standard characters (like !) with double 
#quotes (you're actually writing YAML markup, if you're interested in the reason). 
#
#If your system is set up with the language you are creating the translation 
#for, OpenRubyRMK will automatically pick up your new translation and 
#display strings accordingly. However, if you're translating for another 
#locale than your system's, you have to edit OpenRubyRMK's configuration 
#file (config/OpenRubyRMK-rc.yml) and change the value for "locale" to 
#the ISO language abbreviation for the language you translate into. 
#This will force OpenRubyRMK to use the language you put into the config. 
#
#When you're finished, you should remove this statement and just state 
#(in English) for which language the file serves. If you like, you could 
#also translate this text rather than removing it, but remove the "this 
#is the main locale file..." statement from your translation file anyway, 
#since the "main locale file" IS the English locale file. 
#
#=================
#START OF TRANSLATIONS


#These are some general strings. The "application_name" will 
#be used from OpenRubyRMK whenever it refers to itself and 
#it shouldn't be changed. The "application_slogan" is the 
#string that will be displayed in the window's title bar next 
#to the application name and "description" shows up 
#in the "about" menu as the program's description. 
#And last but not least, don't forget to put your name into 
#"translators"! If you do so, OpenRubyRMK will automatically 
#honor you if somebody clicks on "Help" -> "About..." (or 
#however the menus are named in your translation). 
general:
  application_name: OpenRubyRMK
  application_slogan: "The free and open-source RPG creation program!"
  description: "A free and open-source RPG (role-play games) creation program."
  translators: "Quintus"

#The menu labels are described here. The "name" of a menu 
#is what gets displayed in the menu bar, and the "tooltip" is 
#what you see in the statusbar's last field when you hover the 
#cursor over an item. It's named "tooltip" since the toolbar 
#items use these strings either and if you stay with your cursor 
#above a tool button, you get... right! A tooltip! ;-)
