DESCRIPTION
This is OpenRubyRMK's project Rakefile. It provides you with tasks 
to automatically generate a deployable version of OpenRubyRMK. Usually, 
all you need to do is to execute

  rake compress

which gives you an archive containing OpenRubyRMK specifically 
designed for your platform. If that's really everything you want to 
do with the Git sources, it's enough if you have a recent 1.9 Ruby 
installed. Please note that you won't be able to run OpenRubyRMK 
neither from the Git sources nor from the created archive (except you're 
on Windows). See the project's README for more information on this. 

WINDOWS
To compress OpenRubyRMK on Windows, you have to do a bit 
of extra effort. Since the OpenRubyRMK GUI is written in wxRuby 
and wxRuby doesn't use Windows's Visual Styles by default, 
we added the options to overwrite this default. However, in order to 
work you must have the files "ruby.exe.manifest" and 
"rubyw.exe.manifest" in your Ruby installation's bin/ directory. 
You may obtain them from 
http://wiki.ruby-portal.de/wxRuby#Visual_Styles_unter_Windows. 
Additionally, you have to have the wxruby-ruby19 gem installed 
for your Ruby installation, because OCRA (our *.exe generator) 
will run OpenRubyRMK to obtain it's dependencies. 

UBUNTU 9.10 (KARMIC) AND NEWER
There is a problem with the Linux binary of wxRuby provided by 
the wxRuby development team. In order to run OpenRubyRMK 
(not in order to compress it!) you have to get a binary build for 
your system. Either build wxRuby from the sources yourself, 
or use the precompiled gems we provide at 
http://www.github.com/Quintus/OpenRubyRMK/Downloads. 

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables influence the compression 
process: 

  ORR_MAKE_CONSOLE_APP
    On Windows, attaches a console to the OpenRubyRMK 
    executable. That's useful for debugging, but should be 
    avoided if you want to deploy the resulting archive. Set it 
    to anything you like, e.g. "yes", the Rakefile will only look 
    wheather it's defined or not.
