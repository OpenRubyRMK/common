#Configuration file for OpenRubyRMK 0.0.1-dev
#
#This is the main configuration file for the OpenRubyRMK. It 
#controls how Karfunkel, OpenRubyRMK's server, behaves. 
#Most options are pretty self-explaining, but some maybe aren't. 
#Just for clarity, a Boolean option such as "maximize" only 
#takes accepts "true" or "false" (without the quotes) as valid. 
#Other values may cause unexpected behaviour. 
#
#Some of the values specified here can be overriden using 
#command-line arguments. See `karfunkel --help` for a summary 
#of what can be passed as command-line arguments.

#The working directory OpenRubyRMK switches into 
#at the beginning. If set to "auto" (without the quotes), 
#it doesn't switch. 
#Examples: 
#  startup_dir: "/home/freak/my_openrubyrmk_projects"
#  startup_dir: "C:\Users\freak\OpenRubyRMK-projects"
#Default value: auto
startup_dir: auto
#This is the Ruby installation that will be used for editing 
#games with OpenRubyRMK. If you choose your own installation, 
#make sure it's 1.9 and has the "gosu" and "chingu" gems installed. 
#Examples: 
#  ruby: "/home/freak/myruby/bin"
#  ruby: "C:\myruby\bin"
#Default value: auto
ruby: "/opt/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p136/bin"
#This sets the port where Karfunkel listens for connections. 
#Note that for port numbers < 1024 you have to run Karfunkel 
#as root on *nix machines. 
#Examples: 
#  port: 1111
#  port: 5678
#  port: 80
#Default value: 3141
port: 3141
#Number of seconds Karfunkel waits for a client to 
#greet him before he closes the connection. 
#Example: 
#  greet_timeout: 10
#Default value: 5
greet_timeout: 5
#This is the directory where Karfunkel puts it's logfiles into. 
#It defaults to a log/ subdirectory in the OpenRubyRMK's bin/ 
#directory. The logfile name is always OpenRubyRMK.log or 
#something similar as logfiles are rotated on 1 MiB. 
#Examples: 
#  logdir: /home/freak/logs/
#  logdir: C:\logs\
#Default value: auto
logdir: auto
#Here you can adjust how verbose Karfunkel is. The possible 
#logging levels are: 
#0 - Debug. Do not use.
#1 - Info. Logs much information on what's going on.
#2 - Warn. This is the default; logs only warnings and errors.
#3 - Error. Log only errors.
#4 - Fatal. Log only errors that cause OpenRubyRMK to crash.
#5 - Unknown. Suppresses any logging. Shouldn't be used.
#Example:
#  loglevel: 3
#Default value: 2
loglevel: 2
