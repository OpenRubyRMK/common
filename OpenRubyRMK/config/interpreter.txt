The first line of this file describes which Ruby Interpreter shall be used to start OpenRubyRMK. 
All other lines are ignored. Please make sure that this file is written in Windows newline format, 
i.e. CR + LF, and that the first line, even if it's the only one, is terminated with such 
a newline, otherwise CMD is too silly to execute the command.
