      #This is OpenRubyRMK's server. Every GUI is just a client to his majesty Karfunkel.
      #The whole server-client architecture Karfunkel deals with works as follows:
      #
      #The main component is the server. It's called Karfunkel and it's represented
      #by the OpenRubyRMK::Karfunkel::Karfunkel module. For each Ruby process
      #there can only be one server running. Here all the information shared by all
      #clients is stored (e.g. the project list).
      #
      #Karfunkel listens on a port specified in the config file (port 3141 by default)
      #for connections. If he detects a connection try, he waits for the potential
      #client to send him the +hello+ request (see the commands_and_responses.rdoc file)
      #and if the client does so, Karfunkel assignes a free ID at him and sends it
      #to the client. If not, the connection is closed. Clients are represented by
      #the OpenRubyRMK::Karfunkel::Client class and they store the information specific
      #to a single client, for instance the client's ID.
      #
      #The third and most important component is OpenRubyRMK::Karfunkel::Protcol. This
      #is a mixin module that is automatically mixed into the connections
      #(EventMachine::Connection derivatives, anonymous classes) made. Each connection
      #has it's own instance and runs in it's own thread which means that you can
      #think of the Protocol module as the main component of a connection and
      #to make life easier and make the whole process easier to understand, think
      #of it as the representation of the connection between Karfunkel and a client.
      #It stores that only that information that is important for the connection,
      #which does not have any semantical relation to what Karfunkel or a Client object
      #stores. For example it stores a data buffer to allow commands to be send
      #as parts instead of a whole.
      #
      #So the whole process is like follows:
      #1. Karfunkel starts and listens on a port.
      #2. A connection is made to that port. EventMachine instanciates an
      #   anonymous class and mixes in the Protocol module. All events that
      #   occur on the connection are handled by that anonymous class.
      #3. The Protocol#post_init method instanciates a Client object and
      #   makes Karfunkel reference it. This allows Karfunkel to keep track
      #   of which clients do what.
      #4. When a client sends a request, the connection's anonymous class
      #   handles it. It will query Karfunkel or the client object as
      #   the request requires. One or more responses are sent back over the wire.
      #5. If a client closes the connection, the anonymous connection class
      #   removes the references Client object from Karfunkel's list of clients.
      #   The now unreferenced connection and it's client get eventually GC'ed.
      #6. Karfunkel shuts down, diconnecting all remaining clients.
      module Karfunkel
        
        #This is the ID Karfunkel himself uses.
