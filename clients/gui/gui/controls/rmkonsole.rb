#Monkeypatch IRB to make it able to interact with non-CUI inputs and outputs. 
#The original IRB code doesn't work with the global variables $stdin, $stdout and 
#$stderr if you're interesed. Instead, it converts STDIN and STDOUT 
#directly to file descriptors to which it connects via IO.open. This way, there's no 
#possibility to interact with IRB beside using the CUI. Due to this fact everybody 
#who wants IRB in a GUI has to monkeypatch it like we did here.
