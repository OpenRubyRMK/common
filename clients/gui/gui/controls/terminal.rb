      #A small terminal emulator control. It's not really sophisticated, but it's written as a 
      #control usable with wxRuby. 
      #
      #Please note that this class uses \\n for line breaks on every platform, just as it's superclass 
      #Wx::TextCtrl does. 
      #
      #There are two ways you can use this control. The easier one is just to create a new instance 
      #and then call #define_processing on it, which will associate the code block you pass it 
      #with the terminal. See #define_processing on how that exactly works. 
      #
      #The second possibility is to derive a control from Terminal, which gives you much more 
      #control over how processing takes place. You can override the methods that define the 
      #behaviour of the up and down arrow keys, the tabulator key and what happens when 
      #the user types "exit". This way, you could write a fully-featured terminal emulator. 
      #
      #Here's a simple example of usage: 
      #  @terminal = Terminal.new(self)
      #  @terminal.define_processing do |stdin, stdout, stderr|
      #    loop do
      #      stdout.print("Enter something: ")
      #      str = stdin.gets.chomp
      #      stdout.puts("You entered '#{str}'.")
      #    end
      #  end

        #Whenever you call a method on the standard input of the terminal (which is a blocking 
        #IO operation since the user hasn't entered something yet) the fiber is stopped and control 
        #returns to the GUI, allowing the user to type. When the user presses [ENTER], the entered 
        #text is extracted and written to the terminal's stdin, then the fiber is resumed. 
        #This has one major drawback: If the processing takes long, the whole GUI gets 
        #unresponsive, but since threads don't work correctly together with wxRuby, 
        #I didn't see another way. This process also implies that input always is line-buffered, so you cannot 
        #read a single character without having the user press enter. Use a real terminal emulator for that. 
        #
        #Here's a quick overview about how the processes evolves: 
        #1. You call #define_processing. The terminal is enabled, then your codeblock is stored inside a fiber. 
        #2. The fiber gets called. Since your fiber block hasn't entered it's mainloop yet, you can print a banner here or something like that. 
        #3. Your fiber block calls a method on the terminal's stdin. 
        #4. The fiber is stopped and control is returned to the GUI, allowing the user to satisfy your read request. 
        #5. The user enteres text and presses [ENTER]. 
        #6. The text the user entered (including the terminating newline) is written to the terminal's stdin. 
        #7. The fiber is resumed, and you can process what the user entered. 
        #8. The fiber reaches the last statement and exits. 
        #9. The terminal is cleared and disabled. The fiber gets deleted. 
        #Note, that you should implement a loop inside the block as I said earlier that ensures that the last statement of 7. returns back to 3. 
        #
        #This method yields the terminal's standard IO streams to it's block.
