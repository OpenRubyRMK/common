module OpenRubyRMK
  
  #OpenRubyRMK's CUI. The files that contain what RMKonsole does are a bit spread over the 
  #directory structure, since I wanted to strictly separate GUI and non-GUI classes. 
  #That means, the full inner GUI terminal is formed by the following files: 
  #* lib/open_ruby_rmkonsole.rb (this file). Defines the commands executable in the CUI. 
  #* lib/gui/controls/terminal.rb. Defines the superclass for the terminal widget. 
  #* lib/gui/controls/rmkonsole.rb. This defines the terminal widget's class. 
  #* lib/gui/windows/console_window.rb. This contains the terminal window's class definition. 
  #Theoretically speaking, it should be possible to write a real CUI for OpenRubyRMK by 
  #using the constants and methods defined under the module inside this file. However, practically 
  #speaking that's unlikely, since the visual representation of the maps makes life a lot 
  #easier. Nevertheless RMKonsole may help you to get away with instantly repeating processes. 
  #Just define a plugin for :rmkonsole that encapsulates what you're doing and call the newly 
  #defined method. TODO: Implement the plugin system for RMKonsole. 
  module OpenRubyRMKonsole
    
    #The version of the CUI. 
    VERSION = "0.0.2-dev"
    
    #The banner that gets displayed every time you start the CUI.
