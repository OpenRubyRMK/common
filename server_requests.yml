Eval:
  desc: >
    The @Eval@ request is for debugging purposes. It causes
    Karfunkel to run arbitrary Ruby code (via @eval@) in the
    context of the Eval request. It is *only* available if Karfunkel
    is running in debug mode; pass the @-d@ commandline-parameter if
    you _really_ want to do this. This creates a *huge* security hole.
    As said, this is for *debugging* purposes. If you don't want to
    debug Karfunkel, *do not use* this request.
  parameters:
    code: Arbitrary Ruby code, which may span multiple lines.
  responses:
    ok:
      desc: Your request was processed.
      parameters:
        result: Result of the code, on which @inspect@ was called.
    rejected:
      desc: >
        Karfunkel was not running in debug mode. This issue is logged on
        the server side together with your IP address.
    failed:
      desc: Your code raised an exception.
      parameters:
        exception: The exception's class.
        message: The exception's message.
        backtrace: The exception's backtrace, which may span multiple lines.

OpenProject:
  desc: >
    Makes Karfunkel load a given project file. The project is not selected, 
    that's a separate @SelectProject@ request. The path is understand as
    a path on the system Karfunkel runs on, so you may have to contact
    the person running the server to obtain the name of a project file (or
    just leave it to him/her to open a project).
    
    While the project is being loaded, several @load_project@ notifications are
    delivered and finally a @loaded_project@ notification is send when the
    project has completed loading.
  parameters:
    os: >
      Short string identifying your operating system which Karfunkel wants to
      know for compatibility reasons. One of @Windows@, @Mac@, @Linux@.
  responses:
    processing:
      desc: This is sent when Karfunkel accepted your request and now loads the project.
      parameters:
    finished: 
      desc: Send when the project is in a usable state.
      parameters:
    failed:
      desc: Reason why the project couldn't be loaded.
  notifications:
    load_project: 
      desc: A project is currently being loaded.
      parameters:
        name: The name of the project currently being loaded.
        percent: The percent already loaded.
    loaded_project:
      desc: A project has just finished being loaded.
      parameters:
        name: The project loaded.
