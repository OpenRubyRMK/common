h1. OpenRubyRMK - An open-source and free RPG Maker!
...at least when it's finished. ;-)

h2. Roadmap

The "installer" directory once will contain the installer for Windows systems, but that's for from today - focus on the other directory, "OpenRubyRMK". This directory reflects how an installed OpenRubyRMK will look like; basically it's what an installer would create. To start up the (yet not exisiting) OpenRubyRMK main script, you first have to edit _config/interpreter.txt_ and set it to the absolute path where your Ruby Interpreter resides. This has to be done, since we want to ship OpenRubyRMK with our own Ruby finally, but give the game developer the freedom to use his/her own Ruby installation. Also, you should have a look at the _PATHS.txt_ file which describes where you should put what. 

After setting _config/interpreter.txt_, do one of the following steps: 

h3. Windows

bc. cd bin
OpenRubyRMK.bat

h3. *nix

bc. cd bin
./OpenRubyRMK.sh

h3. License

OpenRubyRMK is a free and open-source RPG maker.
