#This is the gemfile used by bundler to determine
#which gems should be installed.
#For a normal *nix user you have to run
#  $ bundle install --without development
#to make your Ruby ready to run OpenRubyRMK.
#Windows users shouldn't even see this file, as they
#get a *.exe.
#For those who want to develop OpenRubyRMK or just
#want the very latest OpenRubyRMK freshly compressed
#from the git sources, do
#  $ bundle install
#Note that this will install gosu which is a C extension;
#visit the gosu website at http://libgosu.org to
#see what dependencies you need in order to compile
#correctly. For Windows users a pre-build binary of
#gosu exists.
