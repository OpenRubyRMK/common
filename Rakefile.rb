# USAGE:
#   rake [OPTIONS] [TASK]
#
# DESCRIPTION
# This is OpenRubyRMK's project Rakefile. It provides you with tasks
# to automatically generate a deployable version of OpenRubyRMK. Usually,
# all you need to do is to execute
#
#   rake compress
#
# which gives you an archive containing OpenRubyRMK specifically
# designed for your platform. If that's really everything you want to
# do with the Git sources, it's enough if you have a recent 1.9 Ruby
# installed. Please note that you won't be able to run OpenRubyRMK
# neither from the Git sources nor from the created archive (except you're
# on Windows). See the project's README for more information on this.
#
# WINDOWS
# To compress OpenRubyRMK on Windows, you have to do a bit
# of extra effort. Since the OpenRubyRMK GUI is written in wxRuby
# and wxRuby doesn't use Windows's Visual Styles by default,
# we added the options to overwrite this default. However, in order to
# work you must have the files "ruby.exe.manifest" and
# "rubyw.exe.manifest" in your Ruby installation's bin/ directory.
# You may obtain them from
# http://wiki.ruby-portal.de/wxRuby#Visual_Styles_unter_Windows.
# Additionally, you have to have the wxruby-ruby19 gem installed
# for your Ruby installation, because OCRA (our *.exe generator)
# will run OpenRubyRMK to obtain it's dependencies.
#
# UBUNTU 9.10 (KARMIC) AND NEWER
# There is a problem with the Linux binary of wxRuby provided by
# the wxRuby development team. In order to run OpenRubyRMK
# (not in order to compress it!) you have to get a binary build for
# your system. Either build wxRuby from the sources yourself,
# or use the precompiled gems we provide at
# http://www.github.com/Quintus/OpenRubyRMK/Downloads.
#
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# The following environment variables influence the compression
# process:
#
#   ORR_MAKE_CONSOLE_APP
#     On Windows, attaches a console to the OpenRubyRMK
#     executable. That's useful for debugging, but should be
#     avoided if you want to deploy the resulting archive. Set it
#     to anything you like, e.g. "yes", the Rakefile will only look
#     wheather it's defined or not.
# HELP
# end
