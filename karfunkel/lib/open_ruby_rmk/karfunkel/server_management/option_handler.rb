            USAGE:
            karfunkel [-V] [-d] [-l [FILE]] [-L LEVEL]
            
            DESCRIPTION
            Karfunkel is the server component of the OpenRubyRMK.
            OpenRubyRMK is a free and open-source RPG creation program. If you find any
            bugs, please let us know via the mail address openrubyrmk@googlemail.com
            or file a bug at https://github.com/Quintus/OpenRubyRMK/issues.
            Below is a summary of possible command-line options, but please note that
            the -s, -l, and -L options don't have any effect when -d is passed. It is
            not possible to combine the short options into someting like -sV as the
            tar command allows. You have to pass them separately, for instance as -s -V.
            
            Note there is also a configuration file where you can put most of the
            things you can specify via the command-line into to make them persistent.
            The default config file for Karfunkel is
            <OpenRubyRMKDir>/config/OpenRubyRMK-rc.yml
            and if the values set in it conflicht with what you specify on the
            command-line, the command-line arguments are preferred.
            
            The possible logging levels for the -L option are:
            0 - Debug. Do not use.
            1 - Info. Logs much information on what's going on.
            2 - Warn. This is the default; logs only warnings and errors.
            3 - Error. Log only errors.
            4 - Fatal. Log only errors that cause Karfunkel to crash.
            5 - Unknown. Suppresses any logging. Shouldn't be used.
            
            EXAMPLES
            Show additional information on the console while running
            karfunkel -s -V
            
            Same as above
            karfunkel -s -L1
            
            Log only fatal errors
            karfunkel --loglevel=4
            
            Log only fatal errors, change the log dir
            karfunkel -l /home/freak/logs/ -L4
            
            Same as above
            karfunkel --logdir=/home/freak/logs/ --loglevel=4
            
            Use another configuration file
            karfunkel -c /home/freak/myconfig.yml
